## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a **self-hosted gateway** that connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.

**Who is it for?** Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.

- **New install from zero:** [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- **Guided setup (recommended):** [Wizard](/start/wizard) (`openclaw onboard`)
- **Open the dashboard (local Gateway):** http://127.0.0.1:32555/ (or http://localhost:32555/)

- **Self-hosted**: runs on your hardware, your rules
- **Multi-channel**: one Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously
- **Agent-native**: built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

**What do you need?** Node 22+, an API key (Anthropic recommended), and 5 minutes.

The dashboard is the browser Control UI for chat, config, nodes, sessions, and more.
Local default: http://127.0.0.1:32555/
Remote access: [Web surfaces](/web) and [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale)

## How it works

```
WhatsApp / Telegram / Discord / iMessage (+ plugins)
        │
        ▼
  ┌───────────────────────────┐
  │          Gateway          │  ws://127.0.0.1:32555 (loopback-only)
  │     (single source)       │
  │                           │  http://<gateway-host>:18793
  │                           │    /__openclaw__/canvas/ (Canvas host)
  └───────────┬───────────────┘
              │
              ├─ Pi agent (RPC)
              ├─ CLI (openclaw …)
              ├─ Chat UI (SwiftUI)
              ├─ macOS app (OpenClaw.app)
              ├─ iOS node via Gateway WS + pairing
              └─ Android node via Gateway WS + pairing
```

Most operations flow through the **Gateway** (`openclaw gateway`), a single long-running process that owns channel connections and the WebSocket control plane.

## Network model

- **One Gateway per host (recommended)**: it is the only process allowed to own the WhatsApp Web session. If you need a rescue bot or strict isolation, run multiple gateways with isolated profiles and ports; see [Multiple gateways](/gateway/multiple-gateways).
- **Loopback-first**: Gateway WS defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:32555`.
  - The wizard now generates a gateway token by default (even for loopback).
  - For Tailnet access, run `openclaw gateway --bind tailnet --token ...` (token is required for non-loopback binds).
- **Nodes**: connect to the Gateway WebSocket (LAN/tailnet/SSH as needed); legacy TCP bridge is deprecated/removed.
- **Canvas host**: HTTP file server on `canvasHost.port` (default `18793`), serving `/__openclaw__/canvas/` for node WebViews; see [Gateway configuration](/gateway/configuration) (`canvasHost`).
- **Remote use**: SSH tunnel or tailnet/VPN; see [Remote access](/gateway/remote) and [Discovery](/gateway/discovery).

## Features (high level)

- 📱 **WhatsApp Integration** — Uses Baileys for WhatsApp Web protocol
- ✈️ **Telegram Bot** — DMs + groups via grammY
- 🎮 **Discord Bot** — DMs + guild channels via channels.discord.js
- 🧩 **Mattermost Bot (plugin)** — Bot token + WebSocket events
- 💬 **iMessage** — Local imsg CLI integration (macOS)
- 🤖 **Agent bridge** — Pi (RPC mode) with tool streaming
- ⏱️ **Streaming + chunking** — Block streaming + Telegram draft streaming details ([/concepts/streaming](/concepts/streaming))
- 🧠 **Multi-agent routing** — Route provider accounts/peers to isolated agents (workspace + per-agent sessions)
- 🔐 **Subscription auth** — Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max) + OpenAI (ChatGPT/Codex) via OAuth
- 💬 **Sessions** — Direct chats collapse into shared `main` (default); groups are isolated
- 👥 **Group Chat Support** — Mention-based by default; owner can toggle `/activation always|mention`
- 📎 **Media Support** — Send and receive images, audio, documents
- 🎤 **Voice notes** — Optional transcription hook
- 🖥️ **WebChat + macOS app** — Local UI + menu bar companion for ops and voice wake
- 📱 **iOS node** — Pairs as a node and exposes a Canvas surface
- 📱 **Android node** — Pairs as a node and exposes Canvas + Chat + Camera

Note: legacy Claude/Codex/Gemini/Opencode paths have been removed; Pi is the only coding-agent path.

## Quick start

Runtime requirement: **Node ≥ 22**.

```bash
# Recommended: global install (npm/pnpm)
npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or: pnpm add -g openclaw@latest

# Onboard + install the service (launchd/systemd user service)
openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# Pair WhatsApp Web (shows QR)
openclaw channels login

# Gateway runs via the service after onboarding; manual run is still possible:
openclaw gateway --port 32555
```

Switching between npm and git installs later is easy: install the other flavor and run `openclaw doctor` to update the gateway service entrypoint.

From source (development):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
pnpm install
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run
pnpm build
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

If you don’t have a global install yet, run the onboarding step via `pnpm openclaw ...` from the repo.

Multi-instance quickstart (optional):

```bash
OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.openclaw/a.json \
OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.openclaw-a \
openclaw gateway --port 55532
```

Send a test message (requires a running Gateway):

```bash
openclaw message send --target +15555550123 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"
```

## Configuration (optional)

Config lives at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

- If you **do nothing**, OpenClaw uses the bundled Pi binary in RPC mode with per-sender sessions.
- If you want to lock it down, start with `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` and (for groups) mention rules.

Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
  messages: { groupChat: { mentionPatterns: ["@openclaw"] } },
}
```
